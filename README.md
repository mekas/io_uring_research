# Assignment 4, Operating System
The current OS assignment covers large responsiblity, to fully reverse engineer IO Uring through the scheme explained on class previously. Based on this consideration, the period to complete this assignment is extended into to two weeks (before the next lesson). Moreover it's been decided due to sheer size of reverse engineering activities required, this is a group homework. On this directory, I have put io_uring from kernel source. However since only the sub directory was taken, your own IDE could shown many red error dependency warning. If you prefer, you may put the comment on your own kernel source, then later move the relevant directory to this repo.

As a group assignment, only a member representative may take the assignment. Which the forked repo will be created in his own personal space. This repo should be shared among all members such that they all have write access. At most the group consist of 4 students, not more. More means your group won't be recognized, be wary.
