# Assignment 4, Operating System
The current OS assignment covers large responsiblity, to fully reverse engineer IO Uring through the scheme explained on class previously. Based on this consideration the period to complete this assignment is extended into two weeks. On this directory, I have put io_uring from kernel source. However since only the sub directory was taken, on your IDE could shown many red error dependency warning. If you prefer, you may put the comment on your own kernel source, while later move the relevant directory to this repo.
